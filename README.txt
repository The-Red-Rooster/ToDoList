GROUP: N/A, this is a solo project
CLASS: Mobile Application Development, CS458
PROJECT: ToDo List

SYNOPSIS:
This is my final project for the Mobile Application Development class, a ToDo list. It's a solo project that I designed using concepts and
material  that has been taught in the class. It uses a more mobile friendly approach rather than something super simplistic. It offers various features such as a splash screen, a button to generate new user tasks, the ability to "check off" certain tasks, as well as the ability to edit and delete tasks in the list.

FEATURES/OPERATION:
-A splash screen with a basic logo that appears for one second.
-A simplistic interface, oriented specifically for portrait view.
-A button to generate a task that takes in text values.
-Tasks are generated using SQLite databases and will change based on user input and values:
  >Task cards will appear after generating a task. There is no hard limit on the amount of tasks that can be generated.
    +From the task card, the user can check off whether the task has completed or not.
    +From the task card, the user can swipe right-to-left to delete the task.
    +From the task card, the user can swipe left-to-right to edit the task.
    +Inside the card view, the user can scroll up or down the page to see other tasks provided the user has a large amout of tasks.

HOW-TO-RUN:
There are no libraries, dependencies, or other tools needed to get the application started. To run the project, you would run and compile it
like any other project. A basic rundown of said process is outlined below:

Extract the zip archive into the directory that contains all Android Studio Projects. From there, you will have to open the project 
using the open projects dialogue either on the main "Welcome to Android Studio" page or through the top left button (File > Open) 
if a previous project has been opened. Afterwards, in the top bar of Andorid Studio, press the green triangle/play button to build 
and run the project in an emulator.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
